The following describes my attempt at receiving information from the snowcast
server. 

It begins by checking the arguements to make sure they are of the correct format.

It then initiates the handshaking process, opening the tcp file descriptor with the "open_tcp_fd" function, sending the hello message with the "say_hello" function, and receiving the response with the "hear_welcome" function.

It will then automatically set the station to station zero, and enter a select event loop.


The loop will track 3 different readings:
	1. Announcements from the server via tcp_fd (written to STDERR)
	2. The stream of information via udp_fd (written to STDOUT)
	3. Any information from stdin that must be handled. (E.g. setting station, quitting)

A pseudo-wrapper around the "write" system call, named Write, was used to perform the write system call with error handling.

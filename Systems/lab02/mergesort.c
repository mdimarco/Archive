/*
 * Merges two sorted strings that are adjacent to each other in the string str.
 * For example, consider the following string:
 * AQZBCVa321q
 * One might call merge("AQZBCVa321q", 0, 3, 6)
 * because A, at index 0, is the beginning of the first sorted string
 * B, the beginning of the second sorted string, is at index 3,
 * and the last element of the second sorted string is at index 5, so we pass in
 * 6 because our ending index is exclusive.
 * After merge is done, the input string should read
 * "ABCQVZa321q"
 *
 * Hint: Hmmm... looks like the debugging elves in the Sunlab have already done
 * a pretty thorough job with this one. It looks like your problems lie 
 * elsewhere... (Translation: The CS033 TAs guarantee that this function works
 * exactly as described above.)

/*
 * Implements mergesort on a substring of the given string. 
 * Recall the following pseudocode for mergesort:
 function merge_sort(list m)
	// Base case. A list of zero or one elements is sorted, by definition.
	if length(m) <= 1
		return m

	// Recursive case. First, *divide* the list into
	// equal-sized sublists.
	var list left, right
	var integer middle = length(m) / 2
	for each x in m before middle
		add x to left
	for each x in m after or equal	middle
		add x to right
	
	// Recursively sort both sublists.
	left =	merge_sort(left)
	right =	merge_sort(right)
	// *Conquer*: merge the now-sorted sublists.
	return merge(left, right)
 *	
 * The above pseudocode is written in a functional style, where the input to the
 * mergesort function is a list and the output is another list that contains the
 * same elements as the first list, but has been sorted. In C, most mergesort
 * implementations instead use an "in place" mergesort. In this version, the
 * string used as input is mutated so that its elements are sorted. Because this
 * helper takes as input two indices, you should only sort elements between
 * index low (inclusive) and high (exclusive). Some possible helper functions
 * (though certainly not the only possible ones) are given skeletons above.
 *
 * Hint: If this function is crashing due to segmentation faults when accessing
 * very high memory addresses, ask yourself why a recursive algorithm would use up
 * all of a system's available memory. Why did Maze: Generator's drunken walk
 * algorithm need to check if the room it was going to check was even in bounds 
 * before recursively calling itself? Recursion needs limits.

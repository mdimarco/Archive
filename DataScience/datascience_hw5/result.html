            <h2> Implementation </h2>
            <p>My implementation closely follows the pseudocode, adding in the dampening factor on top of it. While I gain a significant change per loop (alpha > epsilon), I go through each node in the pages, and for each of it's links, I update a list of the current node's page rank divided by the number of pages it links to. I use said list to calculate each node's new page rank, combining that value with a teleportation constant calculated before, to account for random page transitions.  </p>
 

            <h2> Results </h2>
            <p>  I've run both an optimized and unoptimized version of the pagerank algorithm, and here are my results:   </p>
            <ul>
            <li>
            (Optimized) Time taken: 1550 seconds.    
            </li>
            <li>
            (Unoptimized) Time taken: 1900 seconds.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            </ul>

            <h2> Optimizations </h2>
            <ol>
                <li> Precalculated the number of nodes (num_nodes) and the teleportation probability (pr_teleport) outside of the main while loop</li>
                <li> In the first loop inside the while loop (updating the new pageranks), I've removed calculations from the inner loop, as can be seen with node_inc and updating the c value, so that the only thing I have to do in the inner loop is update the page-rank itself.</li>
                <li> I've actually noticed a speedup from changing the innermost for-loop from a i in range... to a for each loop (possibly because the program is pre-fetching the rest of the list into cache)</li>
                <li> Changed numbers to floating points, so that python has less to worry about with type-conversions</li>
                <li>By running this with pypy, I get an extraordinary speedup. (from 2-3x) the just in time compilation and memory saving optimizations seem to be quite effective for pagerank </li>
            </ol>

there is a great deal to be said , to be sure , for *UNK* the garbage out of the reconciliation bill .
it would be a good thing if congress started to decide issues *UNK* on their individual merits without *UNK* .
for one thing , no one doubts that the capital gains cut would pass on an *UNK* vote .
since senate leaders have so far *UNK* it up with procedural *UNK* , promises of a cleaner bill are suspect .
especially so since president bush has been weakened by the panama *UNK* .
to the extent that the ual troubles contributed to the plunge , they are another instance of washington 's *UNK* fingers .
as the best opportunities for corporate *UNK* are exhausted of course , at some point the market will start to reject them .
but the airlines are *UNK* a clear case , given anti-takeover *UNK* by secretary of transportation skinner , who *UNK* to believe safety will be *UNK* if *UNK* and british airways own interests in companies that fly airplanes .
worse , congress has started to jump on the skinner bandwagon .
it would give mr. skinner up to 50 days to `` review '' any bid for 15 % or more of the voting stock of any u.s. carrier with revenues of $ 1 billion or more .
so the ual deal has problems , and the market loses 190 points .
*UNK* , mr. secretary and mr. congressman .
in the 1987 crash , remember , the market was shaken by a danny *UNK* proposal to tax takeovers out of *UNK* .
even more important , in our view , was the treasury 's threat to *UNK* the dollar .
the treasury is doing the same thing today ; *UNK* , the dollar is not under *UNK* pressure .
also , traders are in better shape today than in 1987 to survive selling *UNK* .
they are better capitalized .
they are in less danger of losing liquidity simply because of tape *UNK* and clearing and settlement delays .
the fed promises any needed liquidity .
the big board 's *UNK* with the chicago board of trade has improved ; it will be interesting to learn if `` circuit breakers '' prove to be a good idea .
in any event , some traders see stocks as *UNK* today , unlike 1987 .
there is nothing wrong with the market that ca n't be *UNK* by a little *UNK* and common sense in washington .
but on the bearish side , that may be too much to expect .
